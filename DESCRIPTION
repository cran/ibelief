Description: Some basic functions to implement belief functions including:
    transformation between belief functions using the method introduced by
    Philippe Smets <arXiv:1304.1122>, evidence combination, evidence
    discounting, decision-making, and constructing masses. Currently, thirteen
    combination rules and six decision rules are supported. It can also be
    used to generate different types of random masses when working on belief
    combination and conflict management.
